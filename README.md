## 🧩 Problem Statement

Netflix has a massive and diverse content library, which makes it difficult to identify key trends and performance metrics at a glance.

**Key Business Question:**  
*How can we analyze Netflix's movie and TV show data to uncover viewer preferences, track content trends over time, and support better content planning?*

---

## ⚙️ What I Did

Using **Power BI**, I developed an interactive and dynamic dashboard that analyzes over **8,700+ Netflix releases** across various metrics:

- 📺 Content Types: Movies vs. TV Shows  
- 🎭 Genre Breakdown: Top-performing genres  
- 🗓️ Release Year Trends (1925–2021)  
- 🌍 Global Distribution: Country-wise content analysis via a filled map  
- 🔞 Ratings Overview: Age-based content classification  
- 🔍 Slicers & Filters for Type, Year, and Country  

> *I used data modeling, calculated columns (DAX), and layered visual storytelling to build an experience, not just a report.*

**Why it matters:**  
Executives and content planners can use these insights to invest in the right genres, identify underrepresented regions, and time releases for maximum impact.
